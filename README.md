This repository contains the documentation and code for a personal project involving the creation of a reaction wheel system, along with a brief exploration of PID algorithms. The project stemmed from a fascination with the physics behind reaction wheels and a desire to experiment with their practical implementation.

## Overview
The project began in 2017 with the construction of an Arduino-based drone from scratch, which laid the foundation for understanding PID algorithms. Over the course of three years, the focus shifted towards developing a reaction wheel system, driven by the challenge of mastering PID tuning and the allure of basic physics principles.

## Development Journey
The development process involved iterative design, experimentation, and troubleshooting:

* Initial Attempts: The project commenced with basic components such as Arduino Nano and MPU6050 sensor, assembled on a breadboard.

* Challenges and Iterations: Multiple attempts were made to optimize the mechanical design and select appropriate motors, encountering obstacles such as insufficient torque and compatibility issues with sensors.

* Persistence: Despite setbacks and periods of dormancy, the project persisted through redesigns and component replacements, driven by the determination to achieve stability in the reaction wheel.

* Tuning PID Algorithms: The core challenge revolved around tuning PID algorithms for stability, necessitating extensive experimentation and adjustment of parameters.

* Exploration of Bluetooth Integration: Consideration was given to integrating Bluetooth for remote parameter tuning, though it was ultimately not implemented.
